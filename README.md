# Facebook Messenger Analytics


## Purpose

This project allows you get insights from your Facebook Messenger data.  
Facebook allows you to download all your personal data (posts, likes, friends, messages, etc).  
When you launch the code, 4 steps are processing:
- A MySQL database is built on your laptop
- An ETL loads all messages in the local database
- An API (Python/Flask) is started to provide data to the front
- A website is launched (React) to display the insights

```
 Everthing runs localy. Nothing, including your messages are ever uploaded on an external server.
```

## Quick start

### Download your data on Facebook
